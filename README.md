This is the Course Catalog project for COSI 166b.

Given JSON arrays representing the courses, instructors, and subjects at Brandeis University, this web app creates a "course catalog" for students to browse.
Students can sign up as well as add and drop classes to their catalog.
The search functionality uses AJAX to live-update students' search results in the search page.
